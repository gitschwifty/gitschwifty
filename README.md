### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
# I'm Peter
# This is my personal github, don't use it for work though so this is where you can find my public personal projects

I'm a CS -not grad- with a few years of experience under my belt in C, C++, Javascript, Typescript, React, and some blockchain work as well.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at ManyBuild
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust, should probably push a repo sometime but it's mostly just out of the book
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: on here unless you have another route
