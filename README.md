### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Peter
### This is my personal github, don't use GitHub for work so this is where you can find my personal projects & where I contribute to open-source when I can

I'm a CS major (not finishing my degree right now, because of covid, money, and being rather busy) with a few years of experience under my belt in C, C++, Javascript, Typescript, React, and some blockchain work as well.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at ManyBuild
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust, should probably push a repo sometime but it's mostly just out of the book
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: on here? will share email but not for first contacts
