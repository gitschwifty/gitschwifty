### hi there ðŸ‘‹

### this is my github, with some personal projects, open-source contributions, and the one i use for work as well

i'm a software engineer with a few years of experience under my belt in c, c++, js, ts, react, go, rust, and some blockchain work as well.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust, should probably push a repo sometime but it's mostly just out of the book
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: on here? will share email but not for first contacts
